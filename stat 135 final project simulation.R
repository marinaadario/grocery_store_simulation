# You have two steps in the process: cashiers & baggers (some slow, some fast).  
# The customer would have the option of leaving the queue (because of impatience).  
# The number of items purchased affect cashier & bagger speed; they additionally 
# affect the store revenue.  Ultimately the goal of the store is to
# maximize profit = revenue â€“ salaries.  
# What is the optimal number of checkout stations? 

# Customers arrive at rate A (poisson distributed)

# Customers have an average of n items (normally distributed)
# Each item costs an average of d dollars (normally distributed)

# Cashiers and baggers
# Two rates : 
# 1) per item rate: (Ci and Bi) (poisson -> they finish x items in one minute)
# total number of per item minutes for one customer = n/Ci or n/Bi
# and greeting/paying/other rate (Co and Bo) (normal -> takes them an average of x minutes per customer)
# Total time for cashiers = (n/Ci) + Co
# Total time for baggers = (n/Bi) + Bo
# Total time for one customer to be served = (n/Ci) + (n/Bi) + Co + Bo

# Customers leaving the line: exponential, average time a customer will wait before they leave is w 
# (exponential with mean 1/w)

# Cost of cashier: $cost.cashier/hr, cost of bagger: $cost.bagger/hr

# profit = revenue - salaries 
# profit = (customers who don't leave * n number of items * d cost per item) - (number of cashiers * cost per cashier + number of baggers * cost per bagger)

# number of cashiers and baggers from 1-50, do a simulation with each one and see
# find which maximizes profit
